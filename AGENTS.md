# Agent Guide

This repository contains a single Angular 21 website for a HoReCa business. It is a static, prerender-first marketing website with a few simple pages such as home, menu, about, contacts, gallery, reservation, delivery, or events.

## Quick Reference

- Stack: Angular 21, TypeScript 5, Angular SSR/prerender, Tailwind CSS, SCSS
- Package manager: `npm`
- Main goal: fast, clean, SEO-friendly HoReCa landing pages
- Primary output: prerendered static site from `dist/app/browser`

## Universal Rules

- Treat this repo as a marketing website first, not as a complex application shell.
- Prefer simple, static, content-first pages over heavy abstractions.
- Preserve prerender compatibility by default.
- Keep changes small, clear, and easy to review.
- Prefer Tailwind for layout, spacing, typography, sizing, responsive behavior, and utility styling.
- Use local page content/config over new services unless reuse is real and repeated.
- Do not introduce CMS, API fetching, dashboards, or heavy state management unless explicitly requested.

## Default Technical Stance

Use these as defaults unless the local code or the task gives a concrete reason to do otherwise:

- Angular 21 modern patterns only.
- Standalone components are the default. Do not add NgModules for new work.
- Use `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` on new or touched components.
- Use signals for local UI state and derived state.
- Prefer native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) in templates.
- Use Angular bindings instead of manual DOM work.
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for static images when feasible.
- Keep browser-only code guarded so prerender remains safe.

## Decision Memory

Durable repo-wide rules belong in `.ai/decisions/`, not duplicated ad hoc across docs or task notes.

Read `.ai/decisions/index.md` when:

- a task changes a long-lived repo convention
- a task resolves an ambiguity likely to come up again
- you are unsure whether a rule is temporary guidance or a durable policy

## Read Only What You Need

Start here, then open only the one or two relevant files in `.ai/`:

- `.ai/onboarding.md`
- `.ai/architecture.md`
- `.ai/code-style.md`
- `.ai/content-pages.md`
- `.ai/seo.md`
- `.ai/media.md`
- `.ai/tooling.md`
- `.ai/task-execution.md`

Suggested loading order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. one or two relevant `.ai` guides
3. `.ai/decisions/index.md` only if the task may affect durable policy
