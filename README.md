# Angular Landing Template (SSR + Prerender)

Modern Angular 21 starter template for building fast landing pages with **SSR prerendering**, **TailwindCSS**, and **GitHub Pages deployment**.

This template is optimized for static landing sites where pages are rendered at **build time** for SEO and performance.

---

# Features

- **Modern Angular**: Built with Angular 21 for the latest performance and developer experience improvements.
- **SSR & Prerendering**: Optimized for SEO and speed by generating static HTML at build time.
- **TailwindCSS v4**: Leverage the latest utility-first styling for rapid UI development.
- **Zoneless & Signals**: Modern state management using Angular Signals and zoneless change detection.
- **i18n Ready**: Integrated translation system supporting multiple languages out of the box.
- **Auto-Deployment**: Seamlessly deploy to GitHub Pages via built-in GitHub Actions.

---

# Acknowledge

- Angular **21**
- **SSR prerendering** during build
- **Zoneless Angular**
- State used in HTML class bindings should be exposed as **signals**
- Prefer **Angular Signal Forms** as the primary forms approach when building new forms
- **OnPush change detection by default**
- **TailwindCSS v4**
- Use shared **theme CSS variables** from `src/styles/_theme.scss` for colors, surfaces, spacing, radius, and motion
- **GitHub Pages deployment**
- **Prettier formatting**
- Clean minimal project structure

The project builds both:

```
dist/app/browser
dist/app/server
```

But deployment uses the **browser prerendered output**, making it perfect for static hosting.

# Project Structure

```
src/
  app/
    app.component.ts
    app.config.ts
    app.config.server.ts
    app.routes.ts
    app.routes.server.ts
    layouts/
    pages/
  assets/
  environments/
  i18n/
  styles/
  styles.scss
```

SSR configuration lives in:

```
app.config.server.ts
app.routes.server.ts
```

---

# Development

Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

or

```
ng serve
```

Application runs at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

Development mode runs as a normal Angular SPA.

---

# Build

Build the project:

```
npm run build
```

This generates:

```
dist/app/browser
dist/app/server
```

Pages are **prerendered at build time** using Angular SSR.

---

# Running the SSR server (optional)

The template includes a Node server for SSR:

```
npm run serve:ssr:app
```

This runs:

```
node dist/app/server/server.mjs
```

For most landing pages this is **not required**, because prerendered HTML is already generated.

---

# Prerender configuration

All routes are prerendered by default:

```
src/app/app.routes.server.ts
```

```
RenderMode.Prerender
```

```ts
export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
	{
		path: '**',
		renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender,
	},
];
```

This makes Angular generate static HTML for every route during build.

---

# TailwindCSS

Tailwind is configured via:

```
.postcssrc.json
```

Tailwind should be used as much as possible for everyday UI work.

Prefer Tailwind utilities for:

- layout
- spacing
- typography
- colors
- borders
- sizing
- responsive behavior

Use SCSS only when Tailwind is not the right tool, for example:

- component-specific complex styling
- shared design tokens and mixins
- advanced states or selectors
- small amounts of global styling

Global styles live in:

```
src/styles.scss
```

---

# Icons

This template includes **Material Symbols Outlined** and those should be used as the default icon set across the project.

Loaded in:

```
src/index.html
```

Use icons directly in HTML like this:

```html
<span class="material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">arrow_forward</span>
```

For accessible buttons, keep the icon decorative and provide a text label or `aria-label` on the button itself:

```html
<button type="button" aria-label="Open menu">
	<span class="material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">menu</span>
</button>
```

---

# Translations And Languages

UI translations live in:

```text
src/i18n/<code>.ts
src/i18n/index.ts
```

Language metadata lives in:

```text
src/app/feature/language/language.type.ts
src/app/feature/language/language.interface.ts
src/app/feature/language/language.const.ts
src/app/feature/language/language.service.ts
```

Translation bootstrap starts in:

```text
src/app/app.config.ts
```

The app uses the `@wawjs/ngx-translate` translation stack:

- `provideTranslate(...)` registers the default language from `src/i18n/index.ts`
- `LanguageService` switches languages with `TranslateService.setMany(...)`
- English source text is used as the translation key

When adding or updating translations:

- add or update the matching `src/i18n/<code>.ts` dictionary
- keep `src/i18n/index.ts` in sync with the available language files
- keep language codes aligned with `LanguageCode`
- update `LANGUAGES` when adding or renaming a supported language
- keep English source text identical across templates, components, and `src/i18n/*`
- store translation text and language labels as real UTF-8 characters, not escaped or re-encoded mojibake
- remove unused translation keys when they are no longer referenced anywhere in the app

Supported usage patterns:

- Use the `translate` directive for plain element text content
- Use the `translate` pipe for interpolations and attribute bindings
- Use `TranslateService.translate('Key')()` in TypeScript when the translated value is needed inside `computed()` or composed strings

Examples:

```html
<span translate>Open language menu</span>
<button [aria-label]="'Go to homepage' | translate" type="button"></button>
```

```ts
private readonly _translateService = inject(TranslateService);

protected readonly toggleLabel = computed(() =>
	this._translateService.translate('Switch to dark mode')(),
);
```

# SCSS Conventions

Use SCSS in a way that matches modern Angular defaults:

- Keep most styles inside the component `.scss` file.
- Use `src/styles.scss` only for truly global styles like resets, tokens, typography, and utility layers.
- Prefer CSS variables for colors, spacing, and theming that may change at runtime.
- Use SCSS features like `@use`, mixins, and partials for authoring convenience and shared design tokens.
- Avoid deep selector nesting. Keep selectors simple and local to the component.
- Avoid `::ng-deep` and `ViewEncapsulation.None` unless there is a clear integration reason.
- Prefer class bindings in templates over heavy inline style bindings.

Recommended split:

```text
src/styles.scss           -> global entry point
src/app/**/**/*.scss      -> component-local styles
src/styles/_theme.scss    -> shared theme CSS variables
```

---

# Environments

This template includes Angular environment files and they can be used for different runtime setups such as local development and production builds.

Available files:

```text
src/environments/environment.ts
src/environments/environment.prod.ts
```

Typical use cases:

- API base URLs
- feature flags
- analytics toggles
- external service configuration

Production builds replace `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts` through Angular file replacements.

Keep environment files limited to public front-end configuration. Do not store secrets in them.

---

# Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically via **GitHub Actions**.

Workflow:

```
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

Steps:

1. Install dependencies
2. Build Angular app
3. Copy `CNAME`
4. Push build output to `gh-pages`

The deployed folder is:

```
dist/app/browser
```

---

# Domain

Custom domain which you should adjust to your own domain so it works properly, any subdomain of `*.itkamianets.com` in case it's not used before on our github org.

```
ngx.itkamianets.com
```

Configured via:

```
CNAME
```

---

# Code Style

Formatting is handled by:

- `.editorconfig`
- `.prettierrc`

Key conventions:

- **tabs**
- **single quotes**
- **100 character line width**

---

# AI Usage

If you use AI outside the IDE and it does not automatically read repository instructions, copy the
contents of `AGENTS.md` into the AI prompt/context first.

This ensures the AI follows the same project-specific rules that Codex uses inside the IDE.

# Code structure guide

## Pages

Application pages should be created inside:

```text
src/app/pages/
```

Each page should have its own folder and its own component file.

Example:

```text
src/app/pages/home/home.component.ts
src/app/pages/about/about.component.ts
```

Generate a page component with Angular CLI:

```bash
ng generate component pages/home
```

or shorter:

```bash
ng g c pages/home
```

Pages should be lazy loaded from `src/app/app.routes.ts`.

Example route config:

```ts
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';

export const routes: Routes = [
	{
		path: '',
		loadComponent: () => import('./pages/home/home.component').then((m) => m.HomeComponent),
	},
	{
		path: 'about',
		loadComponent: () => import('./pages/about/about.component').then((m) => m.AboutComponent),
	},
];
```

---

## Feature structure for back-end connected modules

If a part of the app needs its own business logic and back-end integration, create a dedicated feature folder inside:

```text
src/app/feature/
```

Each feature should keep its own internal structure.

Example:

```text
src/app/feature/user/
src/app/feature/user/components/
src/app/feature/user/directives/
src/app/feature/user/interfaces/
src/app/feature/user/pages/
src/app/feature/user/pipes/
src/app/feature/user/services/
```

Example service location:

```text
src/app/feature/user/services/user.service.ts
```

Suggested CLI commands:

Create feature page:

```bash
ng g c feature/user/pages/user-profile
```

Create feature component:

```bash
ng g c feature/user/components/user-card
```

Create feature directive:

```bash
ng g d feature/user/directives/user-focus
```

Create feature pipe:

```bash
ng g p feature/user/pipes/user-name
```

Create feature service:

```bash
ng g s feature/user/services/user
```

Interfaces are usually created manually:

```text
src/app/feature/user/interfaces/user.interface.ts
src/app/feature/user/interfaces/user-response.interface.ts
```

For small focused features, colocated files like `feature/language/language.type.ts`,
`language.interface.ts`, `language.const.ts`, and `language.service.ts` are also valid when that
structure keeps the feature simpler.

---

## Generic shared code

Generic reusable code that is not tied to one specific feature can live directly under `src/app`.

Example shared folders:

```text
src/app/components/
src/app/directives/
src/app/interfaces/
src/app/pipes/
src/app/services/
```

Example shared pipe location:

```text
src/app/pipes/phone.pipe.ts
```

Suggested CLI commands:

Create shared component:

```bash
ng g c components/page-header
```

Create shared directive:

```bash
ng g d directives/autofocus
```

Create shared pipe:

```bash
ng g p pipes/phone
```

Create shared service:

```bash
ng g s services/api
```

Interfaces are usually created manually:

```text
src/app/interfaces/api-response.interface.ts
src/app/interfaces/select-option.interface.ts
```

---

## Development summary

Use these locations by default:

- `src/app/pages` - app-level lazy loaded pages
- `src/app/feature/<name>` - feature-specific code with back-end/business logic
- `src/app/components`, `directives`, `pipes`, `services`, `interfaces` - generic shared code

# Create a new project from this template

Clone the default repository into a new folder with your project name (replace `PROJECT_NAME` with your project name):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IT-Kamianets/ngx-default.git PROJECT_NAME
cd PROJECT_NAME
npm i
npm run start
```

### What these commands do

- `git clone https://github.com/IT-Kamianets/ngx-default.git PROJECT_NAME`
  Downloads the template repository and creates a local folder named `PROJECT_NAME`.
- `cd PROJECT_NAME`
  Opens the newly created project folder.
- `npm i`
  Installs all project dependencies from `package.json`.
- `npm run start`
  Starts the local development server.

After that, open the local URL shown in the terminal, usually [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## Initialize your own git repository

If you want to start fresh instead of keeping the template git history, remove the existing `.git` folder, initialize a new repository, and create the first commit.

Example:

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/IT-Kamianets/PROJECT_NAME.git
git add .
git commit -m "chore(init): bootstrap project from ngx-default template"
```

`git remote add origin ...` connects your local repository to the remote GitHub repository so future `git push` and `git pull` commands know where your main project lives.

Use a Conventional Commit message for the first commit as well. A good default is:

```text
chore(init): bootstrap project from ngx-default template
```
